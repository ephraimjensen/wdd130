Hello everyone! I'm  a freshman and a computer science major. I grew up in Hells Canyon on the Oregon side. 
</p>
<p>Summer is my favorite season because I love to go boating, swimming and cliff jumping.
I like to play board games, card games, and videogames.
</p>
<p>I hope to expand my skillset and improve myself by taking this course.
</p>
<p>
    I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my whole life. My favorite scripture is Mosiah 27:29.
